CNN-based Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-ray Images

# Chest X-ray Classification using CNN Variations

This project implements and experiments with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classifying **chest X-ray images** into two categories:

* **NORMAL (healthy lungs)**
* **PNEUMONIA (infected lungs)**

The work follows concepts and examples from *Computer Vision Projects with PyTorch (Apress, 2022)* and expands them with custom CNN variations, augmentation, and batch normalization.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

1. **Data Exploration**

   * Count samples in each category
   * View random images for sanity check
   * Inspect image dimensions

2. **Data Preprocessing & Augmentation**

   * Resize and center-crop to 224√ó224
   * Convert to tensors
   * Normalize using ImageNet mean & std
   * Training augmentation variations:

     * Color jitter
     * Random horizontal flip
     * Random rotation

3. **Model Variations**

   * **Baseline CNN**: Stacked conv‚ÄìReLU‚Äìpooling layers with log\_softmax output
   * **CNN with Augmentation**: Improved generalization using data augmentation
   * **CNN with Batch Normalization**: Added BatchNorm layers after convolutions for stable training and higher accuracy

4. **Training & Evaluation**

   * Loss function: Negative Log Likelihood Loss (NLLLoss)
   * Optimizer: SGD with momentum
   * Learning rate scheduling: StepLR
   * Metrics tracked:

     * Training loss & accuracy
     * Test loss & accuracy
   * Visualization: Matplotlib plots for loss and accuracy trends

## üß† Model Architectures

### Baseline CNN

* Multiple convolutional blocks with ReLU
* 1√ó1 and 3√ó3 convolutions
* MaxPooling layers
* Global Average Pooling before final layer
* Output: 2 classes (NORMAL, PNEUMONIA)

### CNN with Batch Normalization

* Same as baseline
* BatchNorm2d added after each conv‚ÄìReLU
* Improved stability and accuracy

## üìä Results Summary

* **Baseline CNN**
  Accuracy fluctuated, unstable training, test accuracy around \~40%

* **CNN with Augmentation**
  Accuracy peaked at \~80% in early epochs, then dropped due to instability

* **CNN with Batch Normalization**
  Accuracy reached \~90% by epoch 10 and stabilized around \~85%
  Model size increased slightly (from \~12MB to \~17MB)
  Parameters: \~8,732
